# Airport-management-portal

An airport management portal application using React and Node.js is a web-based application that allows airport staff to manage various aspects of airport operations. It would likely include features such as:

Flight schedule management: staff can view and edit the schedule of incoming and outgoing flights, including the flight number, arrival and departure times, and gate assignments.

Passenger management: staff can view and update passenger information, including flight and ticket details, as well as check-in and boarding status.

Baggage tracking: staff can view and update the status of baggage as it moves through the airport, including its location and any issues or delays.

Resource allocation: staff can view and update the allocation of resources such as gates, baggage carousels, and staff to ensure that everything is running smoothly.

Reporting and analytics: staff can generate reports and view analytics to track the performance of the airport and identify areas for improvement.

The application would be built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, on the front-end, and Node.js, a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, on the back-end. This would allow for a fast and responsive user experience, as well as easy integration with other systems and data sources.
